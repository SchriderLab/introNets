This directory contains the pipeline for using dadi to optimize the parameters of the "two-population isolation then migration and exponential size change" model we used in the IntroUNET paper. The contents are:

1) dadiIn/, the bootstrapped input sfs files (100 in total) for input to dadi

2) 2popIM.py, the dadi optimization code used for IM-and-growth model mentioned above

3) launch2popIM.sbatch, which can be used to optimize the IM model on each bootstrap input using a SLURM-scheduled compute cluster (first, one may have to modifying paths and partition names as needed)

4) showAllDadiOutput.py, which parses the output of the resulting optimization runs (which it assumes are in a directory called dadiOutput/), and can be used to create the table of parameter combinations that can be fed into the simulate_msmodified.py script using the --ifile flag

Environment notes:

This pipeline requires python version 2.7, with pyOpt version 1.2, and dadi version 1.7
